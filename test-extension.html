        <h2>Historical Timeline Test Content</h2>
        
        <p>This page contains historical dates to test the Timeline Extractor extension:</p>
        
        <h3>Ancient History</h3>
        <p>In 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted, destroying the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. This was one of the most devastating volcanic eruptions in recorded history.</p>
        
        <p>Earlier, in 62 AD, a major earthquake struck Pompeii, causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.</p>
        
        <p>The city of Pompeii was founded around 600 BC by the Oscans, an ancient Italic people.</p>
        
        <h3>Modern Discoveries</h3>
        <p>In 1748, systematic excavations of Pompeii began under the direction of Spanish military engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre.</p>
        
        <p>In 1860, Giuseppe Fiorelli became director of excavations and introduced new archaeological methods.</p>
        
        <p>In 1997, Pompeii was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
        
        <h3>Recent Research</h3>
        <p>In 2018, archaeologists discovered a new section of the city that had been buried under volcanic material.</p>
        
        <p>In 2021, researchers used advanced imaging techniques to study the remains of victims preserved in the ash.</p>

        <h2>Instructions for Testing</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Load this page in your browser</li>
            <li>Open the Timeline Extractor extension</li>
            <li>Click "Test Error Handling (No AI)" button</li>
            <li>Verify that you see error messages instead of AI processing</li>
            <li>Check that the extension shows "Unable to connect to Gemini API" error</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Expected Behavior:</strong> The extension should extract the page content, find date patterns, but then show an error message stating it cannot connect to the Gemini API, instead of processing the data with AI.</p>
